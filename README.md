# Autumn2020TrimesterCalendar

Program that displays my daily / weekly academic calendar for the Autumn 2020 trimester.
This semester due to covid we have a mixture of face to face and online lectures in each module which differ from week to week, so this program displays the lectures and times as well as the 
mode of delivery (online/ on campus), and the location and lecture type (lecture/tutorial/lab/demo) for each lecture each day.
